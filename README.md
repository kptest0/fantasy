A playground for designing Nirvarnia APIs through fantasy application code.

The source code in this repository is not intended for production. Indeed, it doesn't even work. The purpose of this repository is to provide a place to design the public APIs of various Nirvarnia packages by writing the application code for a fantasy web app. 

The idea is that the source code is entirely self-explanatory â€“ there are no inline comments and there is no documentation.

Browse the ``src`` directory and see what you think.
