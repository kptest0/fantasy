A playground for designing Nirvarnia APIs through fantasy application code.

The source code in this repository is not intended for production. Indeed, it doesn't even work. The purpose of this repository is to design the public APIs of Nirvarnia packages by writing the application code for a fictional website and API. 

The goal is for the source code to be entirely self-explanatory. The PHP scripts in this repository do not include any inline annotations or docblocks.

Browse the ``src`` directory and see what you think.
