A playground for designing Nirvarnia APIs through fantasy application code.

The source code in this repository is not intended for production. Indeed, it doesn't even work. This repository is used to design the public APIs of Nirvarnia packages by writing the application code for a fictional website and REST API. 

The goal is for application-level code to be entirely self-explanatory. For this reason, the PHP scripts in this repository do not include any inline annotations or docblocks.
